Argon Scene Exporter
====================

Overview
--------

The **Argon Scene Exporter** is a MAP Client plugin for exporting an Argon scene.
The plugin uses an Argon document as an input.
The plugin can be configured to export the scene to either webGL or a JPEG thumbnail.

Workflow Connections
--------------------

As shown in :numref:`fig-mcp-argon-scene-exporter-workflow-connections`, the **Argon Scene Exporter** uses 1 input:

1. An Argon Document from a **Argon Viewer** or other plugin. (Port: *https://opencmiss.org/1.0/rdf-schema#ArgonDocument*) 

It does not have a output port, the output of this plugin will be generated in the folder set in config.

Configure
---------

As a minimum, to configure the step, set the name of the step, select the export type required, and set the output directory.
The output directory should be located outside the workflow directory.

   Argon scene exporter step configuration dialog.

There are four other parameters for configuring the step that are optional:

#. Prefix
#. Time Steps
#. Initial Time
#. Finish Time

The *Prefix* parameter, is a string that is placed as a prefix on all files produced by the type of export selected.
The *Time Steps* parameter, is an integer representing the number of time steps to output the export at between the *Initial Time* and the *Finish Time*.
The *Time Steps* parameter, is currently ignored for the *thumbnail* export, the intention is to output a GIF image in the future.
The *Initial Time* parameter, is the initial time to export the scene from.
The *Finish Time* parameter, is the final time to export the scene to.

The *Time Steps*, *Initial Time*, and *Finish Time* are only appropriate for time varying scenes.
If the scene is not time varying these parameters are ignored.
